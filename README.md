## Try it now!

You can [create a repo from this template on GitHub.](https://github.com/YoungX99/v-template/generate)

Or use the `git clone` command to download this template locally.

## Tips

The template uses the icons from any icon sets [🔍Icônes](https://icones.netlify.app/), and the `IconsResolver` is needed for matching the auto-import component's feature. In this template, we agree in advance that the prefix of icon components is `'i'`, of course you can modify it in the `vite.config.ts`.

```vue
<template>
  <!-- both PascalCase and dash-case are supported by Vue -->
  <IMdiAlarm />
  <i-fa-beer />
</template>
```
